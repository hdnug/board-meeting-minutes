  for $111.80. The Vice President seconded. The measure passed unanimously.
* The President visited the Improving Enterprises office to tour the facilities at 10111 Richmond Ave.
  for a potential change of location scheduled for September. He reports that the parking is more friendly
  (easier to access and without charge) than the current location, the WiFi is easier to join, and the
  room is smaller than what we currently have. Improving requires that a representative of their company is
  there during the meeting. The President moved that we change the location of the meeting in September.

  of Improving to accept their offer.
