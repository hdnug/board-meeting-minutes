## Old Business

* The Treasurer has not received access to the bank account, yet. The President will coordinate with the
  Treasurer to get him access to the account. They need to visit a physical branch of the bank, together,
  and get the Treasurer added as a signatory to the account.
* The move of the meeting to the Improving Enterprises offices was announced.

## New Business

* The President will ask Jim Reynolds to speak in July because the Secretary cannot deliver a talk.
* The President moved that the prize for the July meeting be a 27" HD Monitor for $140 from
  [newegg.com](http://newegg.com). The Treasurer seconded. The vote passed unanimously. The President
  will have the monitor delivered to the Treasurer's house since both the President and Secretary will
  not attend the July meeting.
* The President will attempt to find a sponsor because the Group does not have one for July.
