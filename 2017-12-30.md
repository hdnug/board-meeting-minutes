* The President opened discussion on whether we should consider purchasing internal
  computer components for door prizes. The Treasurer posited that we take a poll of
  members to determine if there is interest in having that type of prize. The
  Secretary suggested that the Group could purchase a gaming controller that works
  across platforms, like the XBox One controller. The President suggested that we
  could buy another headset which the Group has enjoyed as a door prize. The Group
  unanimously passed the proposal to purchase a headset for the January door prize
  for $99.99.

  an available speaker for January, then he will speak.
